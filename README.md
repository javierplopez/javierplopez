## ✨ About me!

I’m a graphic designer currently studying Front-End Web Development. My passion lies in blending visual creativity with technical skills to craft engaging, user-centered digital experiences. I’m driven by curiosity, design thinking, and the desire to keep creating — combining the best of both worlds: design and code.
